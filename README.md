What is a function?
A function is re-usable code! With a function you can plug 
in different inputs and receive outputs based on the input.

Imagine a function that adds 1 to any number you give it:

1 -> function -> 2
4 -> function -> 5
The input is on the left of the function and the output is on the right. 
When we input 1, we get back 2. When we input 4, we get back 5.

function in code

function addOne(input) {
    return input + 1;
}
